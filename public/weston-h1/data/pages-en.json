      "content": "DESCRIPTION\nH1 is a Eurorack module designed to\nmake it easy to add harmonic layers or\nbasic polyphony to your modular\npatches. It is primarily designed to be\nused by patching the output of a VCO to\nthe “osc in” input and letting the H1\nderive 2 notes that are related to the\npitch of that oscillator (ie a 3rd and 5th\nto form a major triad for example).\nHowever, H1 can also be used as a dual\nquantizer, a frequency-to-voltage\nconverter, or simply as 2 analog VCOs.\nThe choice is yours.\nAt its heart are two identical channels of\ndigitally-controlled, pitch-tracking\nanalog oscillators and 2 quantizers. The\noscillators make use of precision\nmultiplying DACs (digital to analog\nconverters) and stable reference\ncircuitry so they are extremely stable in\npitch and tracking, but at the same time\ntheir signal-generating parts are\ncompletely analog so they impart the\nfull richness of an analog oscillator. To\nbe clear, H1 is NOT a digital or\nwavetable oscillator.\nAn output mixer section completes the\npackage and minimizes patch cord\nclutter by giving a mix of the pitch-\ntracked input signal and the 3\nwaveforms of the 2 oscillator channels.\nEach channel also can be modulated\nwith true analog through-zero FM.\nImportant or helpful bits will be in red.\nSPECS\nModule Size: 18HP\nDepth: 25mm (To back PCB), 33mm (To\nend of power connector)\nAudio Outputs:\n<=1kOhm Output Impedance\nInputs (All inputs >=100kOhm\nImpedance): CV, Trigger, Lin FM, Osc In.\nPower input:\n+12V & -12V via standard 10 pin\nEurorack connector.

      "content": "MAIN CONTROLS\nMost functions of H1 are controlled\nthrough the row of LED-backlit buttons\non the top of the module:\nYou may notice the leftmost group of 12\nbuttons is arranged as an octave of a\nstandard piano keyboard. The next\ncolumn of buttons is an octave control.\nFinally, there is the display/AB button\nand the Option or “circle” button.\nText written above or below a button\nrefers to the button’s function while\nHOLDING the Option button. For\nexample, the A/B button on its own\ntoggles between selecting channel A or\nB. If Option/circle is held and this same\nbutton is hit, the “display” function is\ninvoked. More in this later.\nOTHER CONTROLS\nDetune:\nIf detune is enabled for the\nselected channel, this pot\nprovides a fine detune for the\nselected channel with a\nrange of +/- one semitone. If\ndetune for channel A is\nadjusted, and then channel B is selected\nand the knob is turned, the knob will not\neffect channel A’s detune when\nreturning to channel A until the knob is\nturned back to the point at which it was\nset while the channel was active. If\ndetune is disabled for the channel, the\ndetune knob will have no effect.\nFM input attenuator:\nEach channel has an input for analog\nthrough-zero frequency modulation\n(TZFM). The knob next to each jack\ncontrols the amount of FM signal\napplied. That is to say it is simply an\nattenuator for the input signal.\nMixer:\nH1 has a mix output which contains a\nmix of whatever signal is input to “Osc\nIn” and the 3 primary waveforms from\neach oscillator. The 4 potentiometers,\nfrom left to right, control the amount of\n“Osc In”, Triangle A + Triangle B, Saw\nA + Saw B, and Square A + Square B.\nThe mixer section has a gain of either 1\n(0db), or -9dB if the “Mix Pad” feature\nis enabled. The Mix Pad option gives\nmore effective headroom to crank the\nmixer controls up more without clipping.\n© 2023 Weston Precision Audio \t5\n\n-- 1 of 1 --",

      "content": "INPUTS\nAs noted in the Quick Start, all outputs have a border\ndrawn around them on the panel, and inputs do not.\nThis standard will be adhered to on future Weston\nmodules.\nOscillator In (Osc In)\nThe Osc In input\naccepts a periodic\nwaveform with\namplitude ranging from\naround 1Vpp to 20Vpp\nand determine’s that\nwaveform’s frequency.\nThe signal input must be of a single\nprimary frequency (e.g. from a VCO or\nself-oscillating filter) in order to get good\nfrequency-tracking results. If the signal is\nhighly wave-folded or filled with other\nstrong frequency content, glitching and\njumping can occur. This may be enjoyed\nby some users though, so by all means\nexperiment and abuse this input if you\nwish!\nIn track modes, the closest note of the detected\ninput signal will be displayed as a pulsating\nwhite/yellow light on the keypad\nIn short, the waveform to be accurately\nfrequency-tracked must have consistent\nzero-crossings. See table below for\nsome examples:\nPrimary CV and Trigger\nEach channel has a primary CV input\nwhich controls the relative pitch of that\nchannel. It can be quantized (more on\nthat later) and has an input range of -3V\nto 7V.\nEach channel’s quantizer also has a\ntrigger input. When trigger in is\nenabled, the quantizer will only output\nthe next quantize step if a rising edge of\nthe trigger input is seen. This trigger\nvoltage can be anywhere from around\n1V to 12V.\nLinear FM\nEach channel has a Lin FM input which\nallows that channel’s oscillator to be\nthrough-zero frequency modulated by\nthe signal input to this jack.\nAuxiliary CV (CV2)\nThere is also an auxiliary CV input\n(labeled CV2) which, when enabled,\ncan either transpose the base note of\none or both channels, or transpose the 2\nnotes of a chord pair together when in\nChord Mode (more on this later).\n© 2023 Weston Precision Audio \t6\n\n-- 1 of 1 --",

      "content": "OUTPUTS\nCV Out & Trigger Out\nEach channel has a CV output which\ncan be set to operate in 2 different\nways. Holding the Option key and\npressing “CV Out” will toggle between\nthe 2 and change the status color of that\nbutton as follows:\nWhen illuminated white, the active\nchannel’s CV output will present a\nvoltage which is proportional to the\nfrequency of the “Osc In” signal, in a 1\nVolt/Octave scale. Thus, in this mode,\nH1 is essentially functioning as a\nFREQUENCY TO VOLTAGE converter.\nWhen illuminated yellow, the\nactive channel’s CV output will\npresent a quantized version of the\nvoltage input to the corresponding CV\ninput. It’s behavior depends on the\nquantize mode described later in the\n“UsingThe H1” section.\nNext to each CV Out jack is a Trigger\nOut jack. If the H1 is being used as a\nquantizer and the Trig Out option is\nenabled, a trigger pulse will appear\nhere each time the active quantize step\nchanges. The signal amplitude is 5V and\nhas a pulse width of 1millisecond.\nIndividual Wave Outs\nEach channel has outputs for the 3\nprimary waveforms from that channel’s\noscillator: Triangle, Sawtooth, and\nSquare. These can be used for more\ncomplex patching and mixes outside the\nH1.\nMix Out\nFor simpler patches and for keeping\npatch cord clutter minimized, the mix\noutput can be used. As described in the\ncontrols section, this mix contains a mix\nof “Osc In” and the combined primary\nwaves from channel A and B (Triangle A\n+ Triangle B, Saw A + Saw B, and\nSquare A + Square B) which are\ncontrolled by the knobs immediately\nabove the mix out. The mixer section has\na gain of either 1 (0db), or -9dB if the\n“Mix Pad” feature is enabled.

All steps are\nenabled in this example.\nIn Stored Chord Mode:\nThe base chord slot is lit in yellow (in this case slot 6) and the\nCV-shifted active chord slot is lit in white (in this case slot 9\nor 6 + 3).\nWhen in stored chord mode and in\npage 2 view as shown above, the base\nchord slot is selected by pressing a key\n1-12. Holding that key for 2 seconds\nsaves that chord to non-volatile memory.\nThe keypad will blink white a few times\nto signify it has been saved.\nDIATONIC CHORD MODE\nWhen holding Option, the\nCHORD button (E flat) will light up\nYELLOW instead of yellow if in\nDiatonic Chord Mode. This mode takes\nthe root input (From either Osc In when\nin track mode or CV A In when in free\nmode) and generates the diatonic triad\nfor that note. This is very helpful\nbecause all diatonic chords always have\nthe notes of that particular scale in them\nand thus they never sound musically\nbad.\nOn the second page of Diatonic chord\nmode (Option + Display to toggle\npages), the key of the scale is shown. So\nfor example, if “C” is selected on the\nkeypad, and a “C” is provided to Osc\nIn, then H1 will generate an E and a G,\nbecause a C major is the first diatonic\nchord of the C major scale. If a “D” is\nprovided to Osc in with the same scale\nsetting, H1 will generate a D minor (F\nand A), and so forth.\nThe key of the diatonic scale can be\nselected through the keypad on page 2\nas described above, and can\nadditionally be selected via CV In B.\nFinally, the diatonic chords generated\ncan be of a major or minor scale. Major\nis selected by pressing Option + Octave\nUp, and Minor is selected by pressing\nOptions + Octave Down. This can also\nbe selected via CV via CV 2 In (Aux CV\nIn). Any “white key” CV will cause the\nscale to be major, and any “black key”\nCV will cause the scale to be minor.\n© 2023 Weston Precision Audio \t10\n\n-- 1 of 1 --",

Quantize\nsteps are enabled/disabled by pressing\nthe buttons in page 2 view as shown on\nthe left of this page.\nuT: The voltage will be quantized to 24\nsteps or “micro tuning” intervals.\nQuantize steps are enabled/disabled in\nthe same way as 12T quantizing, but\nsince there are 24 steps, they are\ndisplayed in 2 pages. For micro-tuning\nquantization, alternate between steps\n1-12 and 13-24 by pressing Option +\nOctave Up.\nOff: The voltage will not be quantized\nat all and trigger in will be ignored. In\nthis mode, a channel in FREE MODE will\nact just like an a regular analog VCO.\nTrig In: Holding option and pressing D\n(Trig In) toggles trigger in on or off for\nthe active channel. If Trig In is enabled,\nthe quantizer will only change to the\nnext enabled quantize step if a trigger in\nis seen. This is useful when feeding a\nrandom or semi-random voltage like an\nLFO to the CV In but you would like the\nnotes to only change in sync with your\nsequencer etc…\nCV2: When in NORMAL MODE, the\nCV2 Input can also be used to transpose\nthe base interval of the selected\nchannel. This feature is toggled on and\noff by holding Option and pressing C\n(CV2). H1 always quantizes CV2 to\n12TET quantizing. When in CHORD\nMODE, the CV2 input can be used to\ntranspose the active chord up or down\nusing a CV.

      "content": "APPENDIX A: UPDATING\nFIRMWARE\nThe firmware of H1 can be user updated\nfairly easily. In the even that a new\nfirmware is available from Weston\nPrecision Audio, the update procedure is\nas follows:\n1) \tDownload the firmware (.UF2) file.\n2) Take H1 out of your rack if not\nalready, and make sure it is NOT\nconnected to the ribbon cable from your\ncase or power supply.\n3) Connect a USB micro B cable to the\nUSB port on the bottom rear of H1.\n4) While HOLDING the button shown\nbelow, connect the other end of the USB\ncord to your PC or Mac.\n5) H1 should show up on your PC or\nMac like a thumb drive does, titled\n“RP2040”. Simply drop the downloaded\n*.UF2 file downloaded from Weston\nAudio onto “RPI-RP2”. FW update is\nnow complete. Disconnect the USB\ncable and re-rack the module.\nFW UPDATE ADDENDUM FOR PRE\n10004 SERIAL NUMBERS:\nFor H1 units with S/N earlier than\n10004, the procedure for firmware\nupdating is identical to the one on the\nleft, but the button from step (4) is more\ninboard and thus must be pressed with a\nflat, non-conductive tool such as a\ntongue depressor, plastic pen handle, or\npopsicle stick. The locating of the\npre-10004 S/N unit’s button is shown\nbelow:\n© 2023 Weston Precision Audio \t15\n\n-- 1 of 1 --",

Connect your MIDI to\nCV device that will be used with H1 to\nthe CV input for channel A being\nmeasured/calibrated and set to exactly\n0.000V. Channel A oscillator output\nshould be at a 32.7Hz C.

It should be within 1 or 2\ncents.\n(2) (Scale) Now make your MIDI to CV\ndevice output a note 5 octaves up from\nthe last step (so, 5.000 Volts). Adjust the\nADC A scale for this channel with the\nOCTAVE + and OCTAVE - keys until\ntuning to a C 1046Hz is achieved.\nAgain it should be within 1 or 2 cents.\n(3) Repeat (1)(Offset) and (1)(Scale)\nsteps until both criteria are satisfied for\nchannel A.\n(4) Repeat steps 1-3 but for channel B.\nSo measure triangle output from channel\nB and connect CV source into channel B\nCV in.
