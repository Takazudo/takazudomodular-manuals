About the AI018 Eurorack Stereo Matrix Mixer\nThe AI018 Eurorack Stereo Matrix Mixer is a compact 8-in, 8-out matrix mixer. A matrix mixer is\nused to route audio or cv signals from multiple sources to different destinations. There are\nsixteen potentiometers, with each potentiometer controlling the amount a given stereo input pair\n(1-4) will be sent to a given stereo output (A-D).\nA common usage for the AI018 would be as an effects send, with one or more inputs, and one or\nmore effect inputs and outputs. Using the AI018 Stereo Matrix Mixer in this way, inputs can be\nsent to multiple effects, and the effects can be sent to each other, and even back into\nthemselves, expanding the depth of the effects.\n\n-- 1 of 1 --",
