      "content": "DESCRIPTION\nSV1 is a VCA (Voltage Controlled\nAmplifier) synthesizer module in\nEurorack format. SV1 actually contains\nTWO VCAs per channel, and these\noutputs are available independently.\nOne pair of VCAs are a vintage-style\ndiscrete bipolar transistor VCA using a\nvintage op amp output stage. The other\npair of VCAs are a modern, 2164-based\nchip VCA using a more modern op amp\nfor the output stage. The “Clean” VCAs\nexcel at low distortion and precision,\nwhile the “Vintage” VCAs offer sonic\ncoloring and tasteful distortion when\npushed.\nSV1 can be used as 2 separate VCAs,\nor as a stereo pair. Engaging the “Link”\nbutton allows both VCA’s Audio In\nLevel, CV attenuator, and Bias controls\nto be controlled by the left set of\ncontrols.\nThis module has several ways to boost\nand drive the signals into it, as well as a\nzero-crossing detector which allows\nclick-free VCA processing of low\nfrequency signals with fast envelopes.\nThese features make SV1 a highly\nversatile dual or stereo VCA for any\nmodular synthesizer setup.\nImportant or helpful bits will be in red.\nSPECS\nModule Size: 12HP\nDepth: 25mm (To back PCB), 33mm (To\nend of power connector)\nVCA Response Type:\nLinear\nAudio Outputs:\n250 Ohm Output Impedance\nInputs:\n>= 100kOhm Input impedance\nAudio Inputs: DC Coupled\nPower input:\n+12V & -12V via standard 10 pin Eurorack\nconnector.

      "content": "USING SV1: GETTING STARTED\nAfter installing and powering up SE1 in\nyour rack, using SV1 is as easy as\npatching an audio signal into one or\nboth of the “In” inputs on the lower left\nand right corners of the module. Start\nby applying an audio signal to the LEFT\naudio in.\nUSING SV1: BIAS\nWith all the potentiometers fully counter-\nclockwise (CCW) and the “Link” button\nnot engaged (LED is off), bring up the\nleft “In Level” pot to the center detent,\nand the left “Bias” pot to full clockwise\n(CW). You should now hear your signal\nthrough both of the left outputs (Clean\nand Vintage) at unity gain. “Bias” is\nsimply a fixed voltage 0-5V that is\nADDED to the control voltage for each\nVCA.\nUSING SV1: OUTPUT NORMAL\nWith the same patch as the previous\nstep, now add a different audio signal to\nthe RIGHT audio input and listen (or\nwatch with oscilloscope) to one of the\nRIGHT outputs and bring up the right\n“Bias” pot. You should hear a mix of the\n2 audio signals. SV1 “output normals”\nthe signals when none of the left outputs\nare used, making it act like a mixer.\nNow, insert a patch cord into either of\nthe LEFT outputs. This will make the left\naudio disappear from the right VCA. In\nother words, installing a cord into a left\noutput breaks the output normal to the\nright outputs. The small triangle pointing\nfrom the left to right outputs indicates\nthis normalizing chain of the VCA\noutputs.\nUSING SV1: CV INPUT\nWith an audio signal patched into the\nleft input, turn the audio “In Level” pot\nto center (high noon) and the “Bias” to\nfull CCW. Now patch an LFO sine wave\nor triangle to the “Level CV” input and\nbring the input attenuator to center (1X\nlabel). You should hear your audio\nsignal modulated on the positive peaks\nof your LFO signal. Now back the CV\nattenuator to around the 7-o-clock\nposition (ie 1/4 of the travel of the\nknob) and then gradually turn up the\n“Bias” pot to make the signal modulate\nusing the full positive and negative\nswing of your LFO CV. This is one of the\nuses of the Bias control - offsetting, or\nadding a DC offset to a bipolar signal to\nmake use of it. The following\noscilloscope traces show the results.\n© 2023 Weston Precision Audio \t5\nFIG 1: NO BIAS\n\n-- 1 of 1 --",

      "content": "USING SV1: OVERDRIVE\nThe “Overdrive” switches on SV1\ndouble (+6dB) the input signal to each\nchannel’s VCAs. The result of this is\ndifferent for each type of VCA. For the\nVintage VCA, the input section adds\nsignificant distortion to the signal when\noverdriven, whereas the Clean VCA has\nlarger input range and will mostly simply\nget louder with “Overdrive” enabled\n(until the output stage clips).\nThe following oscilloscope traces show\nthe difference, with an input signal of a\n10 Volt peak-to-peak triangle wave as\nan input signal. Bias is set to full CW.\nThe flat tops in the blue trace of figure 3\nshow that the Clean VCA’s output stage\nhas begun to clip.\nUSING SV1: ZERO-CROSS DETECT\nThe switches marked “Zero Cross\nDetect” (where zero crossing is shown\nas a symbol of a wave passing through\nzero on the front panel) enable or\ndisable a circuit which only allows that\nchannel’s VCAs to sample a control\nvoltage when the input wave is crossing\nzero volts.\nThe reason for this function is because\nwhen very fast attack envelopes are fed\nto any VCA with a clean input signal\n(especially low frequency basses like\nsines or triangles), a significant amount\nof “click” is generated as the VCA\nopens at various abrupt transitions of\nthe input waveform. The zero-cross\ndetect circuit eliminates these clicks in\nfast envelope CV situations. Note that\nthe zero-cross detect circuit for each\nchannel affects both the Vintage and\nClean VCA of that channel.

      "content": "following oscilloscope traces show the\neffect of this visually:\nUSING SV1: CLIP INDICATORS\nSV1 has 2 sets of clip indicators. The\nupper ones show if that channel's input\nbuffer stage (which is before the VCA\ninput) is clipping. The input buffers are\nrail-to-rail signal handling, so this light\nwill only come on when they are seeing\na signal of around 24V peak-to-peak,\nthus offering the maximum amount of\ninput headroom in Eurorack format.\nThe lower clip indicators show when that\nchannel’s CLEAN VCA has begun\nclipping. The Clean and Vintage VCAs\nhave the same clip voltage range, but\ndue to the different topologies and input\nstages, the Clean VCA’s output will clip\nfirst, before the Vintage, thus the LED\nindicators show the Clean VCA’s clip\nstatus.\nNote, there is no possible damage to\nthe module from clipping either or both\nstages, so do not worry about bricking\nthe LED clip indicators, should you wish\nto highly mangle your sound!\nUSING SV1: LINK (STEREO MODE)\nThe button marked “LINK” is what\nswitches SV1 from a dual VCA to a\nStereo VCA. When “LINK” is engaged\n(LED is lit and button is down), the LEFT\nchannel’s Audio Input Attenuator, Bias\nKnob, and CV Input Attenuator all\nsimply control BOTH channels.\nIn other words, “LINK” make SV1 act as\na stereo pair of VCAs, whereby all of\nthe lefthand controls apply to the stereo\npair.\n© 2023 Weston Precision Audio \t7\nFIG 4: ZERO-CROSS DETECT TURNED OFF.

Turn\nOverdrive on for both channels.\n- \tStereo Waveshaping: Patch the sine\nor triangle output of a VCO into both\naudio inputs and then play with\npatching other different outputs (saws,\nsquares, etc..) into the CVs of left and\nright channel.\n- \tAmplitude Modulation: Patch audio\nrate signals into the CV input to “chop\nup” other audio signals.

      "content": "APPENDIX: TRIMMERS (SERVICE\nONLY)\nSV1 has several trimmers for each\nchannel, which have been adjusted at\nthe factory. Normally these will not ever\nneed to be adjusted, but this section\nexplains their purpose in case of\nadjustment:\nINPUT GAIN (located on pots PCB. 1\nfor left channel and 2 for right channel).\nThese trimmers adjust the gain of the\ninput stage. The output of the input\nstages can be monitored at test point\nTS1 for the left channel and TS2 for the\nright channel. They should be adjusted\nso that unity (1.0) gain is achieved when\nthe input level pot is at center (detent)\nposition. The right channel has TWO\ntrimmers, one for the right channel\nrouted through the right input level pot,\nand the other is for when it’s routed\nthrough the left input level pot. They are\nlabeled “UNLINKED” and “LINKED”,\nrespectively.\nVINTAGE VCA GAIN (located on top\nedge of main (bottom) PCB.\nThese trimmers adjust the gain of the left\nand right VINTAGE VCAs. To adjust,\npatch a 10 Vpp wave into both audio\ninputs and adjust inputs to center. Adjust\nBias to full CW. Monitor each Vintage\noutput and adjust gain so that the output\nmatches the input amplitude.\nVINTAGE VCA CVR (located on top\nedge of main (bottom) PCB.\nThese trimmers adjust the Control\nVoltage Rejection (CVR) of the VINTAGE\nVCAs. To adjust this, make sure no\naudio is patched into the audio inputs\nand turn Audio Input Attenuators to full\nCCW and Bias knobs to full CCW. Patch\na audio rate square wave from an\noscillator into each CV input and set the\nCV Input Attenuators to center. Monitor\neach channel’s Vintage output and\nadjust trimmer to minimize CV\nthroughput.\n© 2023 Weston Precision Audio \t9\n\n-- 1 of 1 --",
