      "content": "DESCRIPTION\nHV1 is a VCO (Voltage Controlled\nOscillator) Eurorack module that\ncontains the best of both the analog and\ndigital worlds. The oscillator core is an\nincredibly stable and well-tracking\ntriangle-core analog VCO which outputs\ntriangle, sine, sawtooth, and pulse\nwaveforms. The triangle of the core is\npassed into a “digital phase shifter”\nwhich outputs a phase-shifted wavetable-\nbased triangle which is parsed into\nsawtooth, sine, and pulse waveforms\nthrough traditional analog circuitry. The\ndigital phase information is also mapped\nto the “WT” (wavetable) output, which\ncan output user wavetables loaded from\nthe SD card on the front of the module.\nAll waveforms can be modulated with\nlinear through-zero FM and exponential\nFM, while all the right-side outputs can\nalso be modulated with pure linear\nphase modulation (PM). This linear PM\nworks like that of PA0, but it has a\nlarger range, spanning +/- 720 degrees.\nThe Wavetable output supports 16-way\ncv-controllable morphing, and tables can\nbe loaded in WaveEdit or Serum format.\nThe digital section of HV1 runs at 16-bit\nand an extremely brisk 150kHz\nsampling rate for high fidelity and low\naliasing.\nImportant or helpful bits will be in red.\nSPECS\nModule Size: 16HP\nDepth: 25mm (To back PCB), 33mm (To end of\npower connector)\nVCO Tracking:\nAt least 8 octaves with +/- 2 cents error\nInputs:\n>= 100kOhm Input impedance\nCV Inputs: DC Coupled, FM Input: AC/DC\nCoupled\nPower input:\n+12V & -12V via standard 10 pin Eurorack\nconnector.

Since\nHV1 has a 16-way wavetable morph,\neach file will show up as FOUR banks.\nHV1 will interpolate each table from\n256-long to the 1024-long HV1 tables\nwhile loading.\n* For Serum files, HV1 assumes that\nthese are large, finely interpolated\nbanks, with each table having the\nstandard 2048 samples and chooses\nto interleave and build a 16-table bank\nbased on the length of the file. So for\nexample, if the table was 256 tables\nlong, HV1 would build a bank out of\nevery 256/16 = 16th table, and then\ndownsample each of those 2048-long\ntables into a 1024-long HV1 table.\n**NOTE: It is very common that Serum\nwavetables have non-standard data written\ninto the file header which can cause HV1 to\nnot load the file. If this is the case, it is\nrecommended to open the WAVE file in an\neditor such as TwistedWave (Mac) and re-\nsave out the file as a standard 16-bit\nmonophonic wave file so that the header\ninformation is compliant and the file can be\nloaded. Also, make sure any 32-bit files are\nnot 32-bit FLOAT, but just 32-bit (integer).\n© 2023 Weston Precision Audio \t7\n\n-- 1 of 1 --",

      "content": "APPENDIX: CALIBRATIONS\nIn normal use, HV1 shouldn’t need to be\ncalibrated, but if for some reason\nsomething needs to be adjusted, this\nsection explains the available options.\nSome are adjusted physically/\nmechanically, and some in software.\nStarting with the physical trimmer pots:\nVCO Volts/Octave and HF Trim:\nLocated on the upper right corner of the\nrear of the module are the V/oct and HF\ntrim. These adjust the scale and high-\nfrequency response of the analog VCO.\nA 1.5mm flat screwdriver is needed to\nadjust the HF trim, and a 2.0mm for the\nV/octave.\nOctave Voltage Trim:\nThis trimmer, located on the right side of\nthe rear of the module is for adjusting\nthe scale of the octave voltage. Only\nadjust this after ensuring the VCO V/oct\nscale is perfectly adjusted.\nRight Sine Trim:\nThis trimmer, located on the left side of\nthe rear of the module adjusts the shape\nof the sine on the digital (righthand)\noutput. Adjust by ear or by using a\nfrequency analyzer. This normally will\nnot ever need to be adjusted.\n© 2023 Weston Precision Audio \t18\n\n-- 1 of 1 --",
