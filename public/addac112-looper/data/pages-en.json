Once lifted from the frame locate the Micro USB input between the two pcbs on the right side of the module. Plug a\ncable to it and to your computer.\nBefore starting the process make sure your cable is a proper standard USB cable.\nSome cables look just like a USB cable but they are used to charge/power other devices and do not have the necessary USB\ntransmission lines.\n1. On the module press encoder > OPTIONS > UPLOAD BOOTLOADER\n2 .Using the Chrome browser go here:\n(You will need an up-to-date version of Chrome, at least version 61 or newer)\nhttps://electro-smith.github.io/Programmer/\n3. Press the “Connect” button and, from the options, choose the one called \"DFU in FS Mode - paired\"\n(ignore platform and example drop menus)\n4. Press “Choose file” and choose the downloaded “ADDAC112_Bootloader_V1.9.bin“ file.\n5. Press ”Program” and it will show some progress bars on the browser, wait until done.\n6. Once finished disconnect the USB cable\nThe module is now ready to receive the new ADDAC112 firmware.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFIRMWARE UPDATE INSTRUCTIONS\n1. Using a computer copy the firmware \"ADDAC112_Firmware_V1.9.bin\" to the root of the micro SD card\n2. Insert the SD card in the SD card slot in ADDAC112\n3. Power off\n4.

This buffer size is normally small in size where grains are so small\nthat can reach the hearing spectrum and be heard as a sort of ever changing complex wavetable, this is\nthe principle behind granular synthesis.\nIn our vision we added the possibility of long buffer sizes up to 5 minutes, allowing “softer” aproaches\nto the granular principle using it as an effect that can generate from “accidental” effects like slight\n“stutters” to extreme processing and transformation of any incoming audio signal.\nThis module is conceptually deep but easy to grasp and operate as all controls are in it’s dedicated\npanel, all jack inputs and outputs have it’s own separate panel to allow no compromise when playing\nit’s controls.\nSome info stated in this document is still subject to change as new firmwares are released.\nFor the first time we sacrificed the module width to leave more space between controls.\n32HP \t13HP\n\n-- 1 of 1 --",

This allows to keep playing a loop granular process\nit while recording a new loop that, in turn, can also feed from these\nsources.\nRECORDING INPUTS MIX:\nAt all times the signal that will be recorded is a mix of 3 sources with\nindividual volume controls:\n1. The Input audio volume is controlled by the [INPUT GAIN] pre-amp\nknob. The [DRY VOLUME] will also have control over the input gain if set\nto Post in the options menu.\n2. The current Loop being played volume is controlled by the [OVERDUB\nDECAY] knob.\n3. The Grains volume is controlled by the [GRAINS FEEDBACK] knob.\nThe sum of these 3 inputs will be sent to the recording head.\nRECORDING:\nThere are mainly 3 different recording methods:\n1. New Rec - Immediate (variable length)\nPressing [NEW REC] immediatelly starts recording a new loop with no\ndefined end point, can be locked into a loop by pressing any of the four\nbottom buttons (Stop, New Rec, Rec or Play) each with it’s diferent\nfunction.\n2. New Rec - On Loop (fixed length)\nPressing [NEW REC] starts recording a new loop whenever the current\nloop playing crosses the start point (i.e. when it loops), the new loop\nbeing recorded will also stop recording whenever the current loop still\nplaying crosses the start point once again.\nThe length of the new loop recorded will then be the same as the\nprevious loop.\nIf, while already recording, the switch is changed to immediate then the\nend point of the new loop becomes free and won’t stop until one of the\nfour bottom buttons is pressed.\nIf the switch is changed back to On Loop later on than it will again start\ntracking the current loop still playing and stop the recording at the end\npoint of the loop. This can also be used to multiply the length of the\ncurrent loop by an X ammount of loops: engage the recording with the\nswitch on the On Loop position, once it starts recording change it to\nImmediate and after X loops change the switch back to On Loop, the\nrecording will then stop once the looper reaches the end of the loop.\n3. Overdub\nPressing [REC] will simply overdub the current loop, the 3 knobs\ncontrolling the recording inputs mix will determine what’s being\noverdubbed.\n[REC] button will also follow the settings from [REC MODE] and [Imme-\ndiate/On Loop] switches\nEvery time the New Rec recording stops, it immediatelly changes the\nselected loop to the new loop.\nDepending on the [REC MODE] switch when it stops recording will either\nenter Overdub, Playback or simply Stop the looper playback.\n\n-- 1 of 1 --",

In these cases users can edit the banks on a laptop removing excess loops or use the legacy firmware to\nload and edit the original old banks.\nNew features:\n- Grains length related to pitch (Page 33)\n- New Loop / Grains trigger outputs lengths, added 100ms and 500ms (Page 35)\n- Original file samplerate and bit depth shown in info screen (Page 39)\n- Show bank name in loading message\nImprovements\n- Improved grains playback when set to a samplerate lower than the looper samplerate (Page 33)\n- improved grain triggering detection (Page 21 & 33)\nBug fixes:\n- Clicks could be heard when new grains would be introduced at sample rates below 44.1khz.\n- Persistant Grains not disappearing after changing sample rate\n- Loop trigger would sometimes fail to output\n- Menu not working correctly when playing in clocked mode\n- Fixed free mem info not showing if the bank had no loops\n- Fixed bug where recording time was incorrectly limited\n- Fixed first grain sometimes starting at -24 pitch\n- Fixed the dB value shown in loop editor - before, it showed the left channel value on both channels\nEdited\n\n-- 1 of 1 --",
