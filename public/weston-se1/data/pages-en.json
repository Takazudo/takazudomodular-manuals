      "content": "DESCRIPTION\nSE1 is an analog ADSR envelope-\ngenerating module in Eurorack format. It\ngenerates a standard Attack/Decay/\nSustain/Release type envelope with a\nsimple gate signal. Unlike many ADSR\nmodules, SE1 allows the time/voltage\nfunction of each stage A/D/R to be\nselected independently between\nLogarithmic, Linear, or Exponential,\nallowing unique envelope shapes.\nEach parameter of the ADSR envelope is\nCV-controllable. Additionally, there is a\nVCA in front of the “S” sustain CV signal\nwhich can be controlled with the\n“Sustain Env In” input. This allows, for\nexample, a second envelope to be\ntriggered from another module which\ncould shape an attack and decay of a\nsustain tremolo swell.\nEach state of the envelope A/D/S/R has\na gate output which goes high for the\nduration of that state. Additionally, there\nis an “EOC” (End Of Cycle) output\nwhich emits a ~1ms pulse when the\ncurrent envelope has completed.\nFinally, there is another VCA on the\noutputs (inverted and regular) of the\nenvelope generator, allowing for CV\ncontrol of the amplitude of the envelope\nsignal.\nImportant or helpful bits will be in red.\nSPECS\nModule Size: 12HP\nDepth: 25mm (To back PCB), 33mm (To\nend of power connector)\nEnvelope Attack/Release Times:\n1ms - 15s (faster possible with negative CVs)\nAudio Outputs:\n<=1kOhm Output Impedance\nInputs:\n>= 100kOhm Input impedance\nGate Input High:\n>2V\nPower input:\n+12V & -12V via standard 10 pin Eurorack\nconnector.

      "content": "USING SE1: GETTING STARTED\nAfter installing and powering up SE1 in\nyour rack, getting an envelope out is as\neasy as applying a signal to the Gate/\nTrigger input in the upper right corner of\nthe module. With the Gate/Trigger\nswitch set to “Gate”, the following is a\ntypical output:\nThe red trace shows the signal sent to\nGate/Trigger input, and the blue is the\nmain output of SE1. Note that all shape\ncontrols are set to linear (center\nposition). Also note, the button\npositioned directly below the Gate/\nTrigger input can be pressed to\nmanually trigger SE1 without any signal.\nUSING SE1: SHAPE CONTROLS\nThe Attack, Decay, and Release sections\nof the envelope can be independently\nselected via the switches labeled “Shape\nControl Switches” in the panel overview\non page 3.

      "content": "Exponential Decay & Log Release:\nUSING SE1: GATE VS. TRIGGER\nThe Gate/Trigger select switch works as\nfollows:\n• When GATE is selected, SE1 treats the\nincoming signal as a gate, and an\nADSR type envelope is produced,\nwhereby the Release part of the\nenvelope starts when the gate signal\ngoes low.\n• When TRIGGER is selected, SE1\ngenerates a trigger pulse from\nwhatever gate or trigger signal is\ninput to SE and thus a AD type\nenvelope is triggered, whereby the\nenvelope attacks until it hits peak\nvoltage, and then decays on its own.\nThe S and R portions of the envelope\nare thus never entered when in\nTRIGGER mode.\nThe following image shows the gate\nsignal (blue) and the envelope output\n(red) when the Gate/Trigger switch is\nset to TRIGGER:\nNote the above envelope would look\nexactly the same if the length of the gate\nwas different than that shown.\nUSING SE1: LOOP\nSE1 allows the ADSR-type envelope to\nbe “looped”. When the Loop switch is\nturned ON, SE1 will simply bounce\nbetween the ATTACK and DECAY states,\nwith the limits being the peak envelope\nvoltage and the SUSTAIN voltage level\nfor as long as the gate signal is held\nhigh. Once the gate is released, SE1 will\nRELEASE as normal. Below is an\nexample of SE1 looping with all shape\ncontrols set to linear:\n© 2023 Weston Precision Audio \t6\n\n-- 1 of 1 --",

      "content": "USING SE1: SUSTAIN CVs\nSE1 is unlike many ADSR modules in\nthat it servos to the sustain voltage while\nin the sustain state. Most ADSR modules\nstop decaying at whatever the current\nsustain voltage is, and sit there until\nanother re-firing of the envelope. SE1\nwill stop decaying at the current sustain\nvoltage, and then continue to servo the\nintegrating capacitor to any new sustain\nvoltage. This means any AC signal can\nbe input to the SUSTAIN CV input to\ncreate something like this:\nNote the signal input to SUSTAIN CV is\nsummed (added) to the voltage from the\nSUSTAIN potentiometer.\nAdditionally, the signal which goes into\nSUSTAIN CV passes first through a\nVCA. The control voltage of this VCA is\nlabelled SUSTAIN ENV IN. The\nfollowing image shows a sinusoidal LFO\npatched to SUSTAIN ENV IN, and a\nhigher frequency sine wave patched to\nSUSTAIN CV:\nOTHER FEATURES: STATE GATES /\nEOC PULSE\nDuring any part of an actively occurring\nenvelope, the corresponding State Gate\nfor that section of the envelope will go\nhigh.\nWhen an active envelope (ADSR or AD)\nfinish and return to zero volts, SE1 will\noutput a pulse to the EOC output.

      "content": "APPENDIX: OUT LEVEL JUMPER\nFor flexibility, SE1 can be configured so\nthat the main envelope output peak\nvoltage is either 5V or 8V. To change\nthe setting, remove the 3 screws from\nthe back of the module and carefully\npull off the rear PCB. There is a jumper\non the lower right corner of this PCB\nlabeled 5V and 8V. Note that, you must\nhave this jumper installed in one of the 2\npossible orientations. If the jumper is\nmissing, SE1 will output nothing from the\nmain outputs.\nAPPENDIX: TRIMMER\nADJUSTMENTS\nNormally, SE1 will require no\nadjustments and will be calibrated only\nupon initial construction. However, if the\nadjustments available will be described\nhere:\nZero Volts Adjustment (Accessed from\nLEFT side of module):\nTo adjust the 0V trimmer, remove all\ninputs and outputs from SE1 and make\nsure it its powered up. Monitor the main\noutput with a voltmeter or oscilloscope\nand simply adjust the “0V” labeled\ntrimmer until 0V is obtained.\nLevel CV Null Adjustment (Accessed\nfrom BOTTOM side of module):\nTo adjust the LEV trimmer, install an\nunconnected patch cord into the “Level”\ninput and then continuously trigger an\nenvelope with an LFO or other source.\nMonitor the main output with an\noscilloscope and adjust the LEV trimmer\nclockwise until you see a signal on the\noscilloscope. Then , turn the LEV trimmer\nback counter-clockwise until the signal\n*just* disappears.\n© 2023 Weston Precision Audio \t9\n\n-- 1 of 1 --",
