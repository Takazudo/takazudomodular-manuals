Most random values will be around this position\nwith more or less deviation depending on the [SPREAD] value. In\nour modified version of the normal distribution, if the calculated\nvalue is outside the selected voltage range, it is brought back\ninside the range.\nWalk (WALK), like uniform distribution has equal probability for\nall possible values but restrains it’s range within a proximity to\nthe previous value, resulting in a plot similar to the stock\nmarket as an example.\nThe probabilistic distribution is further influenced by the\nlinearity parameter, which tilts the probability distribution either\ntowards the lower or higher ranges.\nMODES\nThe CV out value will have different probability characteristics,\ndepending on the mode setting:\n1. OFF\nUniform distribution (equal probability for all CV values)\n2.
